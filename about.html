            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name's Alex, I am a junior at High Point University currently pursuing a B.S. in computer science with a specialization in cybersecurity. I grew up in McLean, VA and was a dedicated swimmer, going as far as the junior Olympics in middle school. In high school, I began my career towards computer science by building my own computer and taking what courses were offered. Now, in college, I've expanded greatly on my academics by obtaining multiple certificates, taking high-level courses, and working as an information technology assistant at High Point's IT desk. I'm currently working on CompTIA's Security+ exam, this website, and designing a video game through Android Studio. I'm excited to see where my interests and skills take me and am always looking for something new to learn.</p>
