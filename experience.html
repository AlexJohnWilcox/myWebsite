            <div class="exp-desc"><em>In the summer between my junior and senior year I had the amazing opportunity to work at Digital Cloak LLC as a systems administration intern. In this role, I worked with three other interns on various projects such as an external network assessment, the creation of a C2 server, and my personal phishing project. I spent most of the time working on my personal project, which was an in depth phishing campaign using Evilginx2 to host a reverse proxy of various sites, and multiple Gophish campaigns in an attempt to harvest credentials in an ethical and regulated way.

This experience was great for me since the families in my neighborhood are very friendly, and after being inside for most of junior year, I got to be outside for most of the day swimming and teaching.</em></div>
