            <div class="exp-desc"><em>In the summer between my junior and senior year I had the amazing opportunity to work at Digital Cloak LLC as a systems administration intern. In this role, I worked with three other interns on various projects such as an external network assessment, the creation of a C2 server, and my personal phishing project. I spent most of the time working on my personal project, which was an in-depth phishing campaign using Evilginx2 to host a reverse proxy of various sites, and multiple Gophish campaigns in an attempt to harvest credentials in an ethical and regulated way. Check out the projects tab to view my final presentation from my project!</em></div>

            <div class="exp-desc"><em>Unfortunately between my sophomore and junior year of high school, a global pandemic had interrupted most of daily life, so I didn't have many opportunities to work jobs or help in my community. So, I took the time to learn some basic coding in Python and C using various online resources like W3 schools and YouTube.

This was my first experience working a job in the field that I love and I enjoyed every moment. I got to help deliver technical support to faculty and students by diagnosing and resolving complex software, network, and hardware problems. I also got to gain some practical experience using the ServiceNow ticketing system, and helped to educate students and faculty on IT best practices such as password management, responsible data use, and phishing attempts.</em></div>
